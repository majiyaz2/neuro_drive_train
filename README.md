# Car Crush - Neural Network Racing Simulation

A racing simulation with neural network-driven cars, featuring a modern web-based frontend using PixiJS and TypeScript.

## Overview

Car Crush is a visualization and simulation platform for training neural network models to drive racing cars. The system provides real-time rendering, physics-based movement, and interactive visualization of AI decision-making.

## Features

- **Racetrack Rendering** - Background and overlay images for immersive track visualization
- **Animated Car Sprites** - Physics-based movement with smooth animations
- **Radar Beams** - Visual detection system showing track boundary sensing
- **Checkpoint System** - Progress tracking as cars navigate the course
- **Neural Network HUD** - Real-time visualization of AI decision-making and statistics
- **Simulation Loop** - Frame-based updates for smooth gameplay

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: PixiJS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: tRPC API integration
- **Rendering**: WebGL-accelerated 2D graphics
